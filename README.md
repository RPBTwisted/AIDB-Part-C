AIDB Part C
--------------------------

Default steps taken from the demo.

apt-get install maven

cd into the main directory and run

mvn spring-boot:run

The application will boot up and make itself available on port 8080.

The application requires a MySQL database named spring_guestbook to exist with a username of "username" and a
password of "password".

This assignment is submitted as a part of AIDB for Leeds Beckett University. It is essentially just the demo imported into Intellij as a part of the first task. Ideally, more would be done although time and work prevented this unfortunately.
